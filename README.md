# GraphQL - REST

This project is a part of my bachelor thesis.
It helps to understand the difference of GraphQL and REST in both implementation and execution.

It consists of four parts:

### 1. Mongo Database

### 2. Apollo Server for GraphQL Requests

runs at http://localhost:5000/

    cd .\be_apollo_graphql\`
    npm start`

### 3. Express Server for REST Requests

runs at http://localhost:8080/

    cd .\be_express_rest\
    npm start

### 4. React.js Frontend for displaying Results

runs at http://localhost:3000/

    cd .\fe\
    npm start
